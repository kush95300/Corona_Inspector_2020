# Corona_Inspector_2020

## Introduction

Corona Inspector is an android application which is used to detect whether a person is having Corona or not with more than 85 % accuracy. This application is useful for detecting corona positive patients. It is based on Machine Learning model with Python-3. It has two model: model -1 is basic model and model-2 is advanced model, which is select own by application as per patient symptoms. Every one can use this application whether it is belongs to technical background or not. It has also added government and other corona information site for COVID latest details. 

# Requirements 

There are only 2 requirements to run this application:
    1.	There should be android device.
    2.	Android device should have internet connectivity.

### Main menu brief discription :
<dl>
  <dt>Corona test - </dt>
  <dd> By clicking on corona test the user will redirect to the site where there is a symptom checker form which is required to fill by user. If on first page modal predict user vulnerable than  the user will be  redirected to the second page which is created using advanced model for better prediction. Then user will fill the second form and hit submit button than model will predict whether it is COVID positive or not.</dd>
  <dt>Corona Image</dt>
  <dd>- where you can search for Corona related images. This is corona images on google. </dd>
    <dt>Corona Information and Tips </dt>
    <dd>- by clicking on this option the user will redirect to the ministry of health and family welfare site for checking COVID related updates. This also contain tips, song and worldinfo site also for more corona updates.</dd>

## Brief Description of Model :

1. By using csv file of COVID Symptoms we trained a binary classification  model using Logistic Regression Method with more than 85% accuracy .
2. packages used are numpy,pandas,os,sklearn,seaborn and matplotlib (for feature elimination y graph), ols methon for feature selection.
3. This modal is based only on 127 data entry. Soon we are uploading model with nearly 7000 people dataset trained model.

## Procedure

### Methods which we can use :

1. Simple Procedure (good but temporary) :

2. Complex Procedure (best but tempory) :

3. Super Complex Procedue (best and almost permanent :

### Method which we used 



## Procedure 

<dl>
    <dt>Modal Train </dt>
    <dd>- We trained modal using binary classification  model (ols method) for feature selection and using Logistic Regression Method trained model with more than 85% accuracy.</dd>
    
   <dt>App Development </dt>
    <dd>- 2.	We have created our android app using sketchware with very simple menu which have 3 or 4 features.</dd>
    
   <dt>Modal Integration </dt>
    <dd>- for modal integration we use flask and make html pages to make form to get data and then by using APIs and request integrate modal and html pages using flask.</dd>
    
   <dt>Modal host </dt>
    <dd>- we host modal over cloud by pythonanywhwew.com services for permanent and free setup. </dd>
  </dl>

## NOTE: This app is a prototype and available only for  3 months.
